# Write a Python script that reads in the csv file `data.csv` and generates 
# a boxplot as shown in the image in ./img.
# 
# Read the CSV file `data.csv` into a numpy array (hint: the delimiter in the 
# file is `','`). In order to achieve full marks, ensure your code will run on 
# another computer (even another operating system) without needing to be edited.
# 
# Create a boxplot using matplotlib using the data in the 5th column of the csv 
# file in ./csv. Set the notch to be `True` and change the symbols of the outliers 
# to be blue diamonds, `'bD'`. Set the plot title and labels to match the image
