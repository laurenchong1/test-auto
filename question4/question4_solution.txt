Fill in the below blank ASCII art version of UML class diagram 
with the relevant information about the Bicycle Class.

You do not need to indicate what is supposed to be private vs public
as that is not enforced in Python, but do mark whether something is an
instance or class attribute by putting (i) or (c) before the 
name.

For example, identify a class attribute as:

(c) class_attribute_name
